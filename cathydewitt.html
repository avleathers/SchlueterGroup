                                    the state of Texas. Under her tenure, TAB’s lobby team was named as one of
                                    the
                                    powerful lobby teams in Texas.

                                <p>During the 86th Session DeWitt was added to Capitol Inside’s ‘Top 100 Hired Guns’
                                    ranking.</p>
                                <p>DeWitt was a lobbyist and policy expert on business issues such as labor law,
                                    health
                                    care, criminal justice, privacy, immigration, non-subscription, tort reform,

                                    compensation. Well known and respected at the Capitol, she is known for her

                                    and direct approach to lobbying. At TAB, she was known to stick to her guns
                                    and to
                                    not negotiate on bad bills when it would add to the cost of doing business
                                    in Texas.
                                    Her philosophy then and now is that legislation should build the economy and
                                    create
                                    more good paying jobs for all Texans, otherwise government should step out
                                    of the
                                    way and let private business thrive.
